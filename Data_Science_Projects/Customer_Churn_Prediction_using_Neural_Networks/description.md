# Neural Network Performance Analysis Project

## Overview

This project builds, trains, and evaluates a neural network model to
predict customer churn using structured data. It demonstrates key data
science competencies preprocessing, model training, performance
evaluation, and interpretability through visualization.

## Objective

To develop a robust neural network capable of predicting outcomes with
high accuracy and interpret the factors influencing predictions.

## Workflow

1.  **Data Preparation:** Cleaned and normalized dataset for optimal
    training.
2.  **Model Training:** Implemented a feedforward neural network with
    ReLU activations.
3.  **Performance Visualization:**
    -   **Loss & Accuracy Curves:** Showed learning trends and minor
        overfitting.
    -   **ROC Curve (AUC = 0.84):** Indicated strong classification
        ability.
4.  **Feature Importance:** Applied Random Forest to reveal key
    predictors behind churn decisions.

## Results
